# Welcome to My Vocabulary
In fact, **My Vocabulary** helps you manage **your** vocabulary. It can be used in different ways, but main goal is to keep words which you already know or you want to learn them properly. 

## Usage
There are four tabs: **Known**, **Bad Known**, **Unknown** and hidden **Blocked**. **Known** tab can be used for words which you know precisely. *Bad Known* tab may contains words that you want to learn in the near future. **Unknown** is the tab for words with which you definitely not familiar. Finally, words which were deleted go to **Blocked**. New words can be imported through **Import** button. Word is imported from raw text if the word not exists in the tabs **Known** and **Blocked** (if another option not selected during importing).
